- 👋 Hi, I’m Henry and I am an inspiring data scientist.

- 👀 I’m interested in constructing a system and thought process to solve the problems piece by piece and layer by layer. Meanwhile, it is also my strengthen and passion to communicate with different audience and address each individual's point. After all, everyone has their own perspectives and I would love to know what they are thinking then I would provide a tail-made and precised solution. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, Machine Learning and other important skills in data science.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects including but not limit to sports analysis and operation optimization. In fact, I had background working in two professional baseball leagues and am currently in charge of an international branch office at a multi-nation corporation.
